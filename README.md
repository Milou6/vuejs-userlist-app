# User List Vuejs App

## About

I created this small application in 3 days as a technical challenge for a job interview📘.

The requirements were to use Vue 3.* with TypeScript and Axios, as well as TailwindCSS🍃 for bonus points.

## App details

The app can be accessed via this link : [milou6.github.io/vuejs-userlist-app/](milou6.github.io/vuejs-userlist-app/)

User's prefered theme (Dark/Light) is set upon 1st visit, but can be manually overriden with the 🌙☀️ button on the corner.
The User can easily navigate through the forms/buttons with `Tab` & `Shift+Tab`.

The app styling was done almost 100% with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and the mock API requests with axios and [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/).
